## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project was to utilize D3 to analyze the health risks facing particular demographics.
To visualize this information an interactive graph was created utilizing 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau.

## Graph 1 
An initial scatter plot was created to view the correlation between Healthcare vs. Poverty, with each state abbreviation provided in a circle on the graph. 


## Graph 2
A second graph was created to analyze additional parameters. You may now see the correlation between different X and Y parameters. 
In addition to the added X and Y parameters which shift the graph, you may also hover over any of the state abbreviations for more information on that states particular values.
